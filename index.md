# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA](https://www.asu.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yang Weng](https://www.public.asu.edu/~yweng2/). My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **power systems**, with a particular focus on data-driven methods for smart grid applications.

I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Shandong University, Jinan, China](https://en.sdu.edu.cn), and an M.Sc. from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu). I was honored to receive the University Graduate Fellowship in 2021.
